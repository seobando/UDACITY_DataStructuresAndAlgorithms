## Efficiency

### Time Complexity:

get(key): The time complexity of the get method is O(1). This is because both the dictionary lookup and the operations to move the item to the end of the OrderedDict (removal and reinsertion) are O(1) operations.

set(key, value): The time complexity of the set method is also O(1). This is because checking the length of the dictionary, removing the oldest item, and adding a new item are all O(1) operations in an OrderedDict.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the LRU_Cache class is O(n), where n is the capacity of the cache. This is because we store up to n items in the OrderedDict. Each entry in the dictionary requires O(1) space, leading to a total space requirement proportional to the capacity.

## Code Design

### Algorithm Choice:

The choice of using an OrderedDict from the collections module is excellent for implementing an LRU cache. The OrderedDict maintains the order of insertion and allows for efficient reordering of elements, which is crucial for the LRU functionality.
Data Structure:

The OrderedDict is an appropriate data structure for this problem because it maintains the order of keys based on their usage. The most recently used item is always moved to the end of the dictionary, and the least recently used item is always at the beginning. This makes the operations of adding new items and evicting the oldest items very efficient.
Readability
The code is well-structured and easy to read. The class and methods are named appropriately, and the comments provide clear explanations of what each part of the code does.

The use of OrderedDict and standard dictionary operations makes the code concise and expressive.

The test cases at the end of the code are clearly defined and cover various scenarios, including edge cases such as a single-element cache, an empty cache, and handling very large values.
