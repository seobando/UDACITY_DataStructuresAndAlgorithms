# Efficiency

## Time Complexity:

The is_user_in_group function checks if a user is in the current group and, if not, recursively checks all subgroups. Let G be the total number of groups and U be the average number of users per group.

In the worst case, the function might need to check each user in each group and each subgroup, leading to a time complexity of O(G√óU). This is because in the worst case, each group has to be traversed and each user's membership checked.

## Space Complexity:

The primary space usage comes from the recursive calls on the call stack.
In the worst case, the depth of the recursive calls could be equal to the maximum depth of the group hierarchy, which can be denoted as ùê∑.

The space complexity due to the call stack is O(D).

Additional space is used for storing groups and users, but this is typically O(G+U), where G is the number of groups and U is the total number of users across all groups. This storage space is fixed and not dependent on the function call depth, hence less relevant to the immediate space complexity of the function execution.

# Code Design

Class Design: The Group class has methods to manage groups and users. This encapsulation is beneficial for maintaining and updating group-user relationships.
add_group and add_user methods allow dynamic modification of the group‚Äôs structure.
get_groups, get_users, and get_name provide controlled access to the group‚Äôs attributes, promoting encapsulation and data integrity.

Recursive Algorithm: The recursive approach in is_user_in_group is intuitive for checking membership within nested structures.
Pro: The code is simple and easy to understand.
Con: Recursive depth could lead to stack overflow if the group hierarchy is too deep (though Python handles reasonably deep recursion well).
