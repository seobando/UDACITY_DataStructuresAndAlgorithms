# Efficiency

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the find_files function is O(n), where n is the total number of files and directories in the directory tree rooted at path. This is because the os.walk() function traverses every directory and file in the specified path once.

## Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of files that match the given suffix. This is due to the list files_with_suffix storing these file paths. Additionally, os.walk() generates a large amount of data temporarily held in memory, but this is handled internally by Python and is not part of the function's explicit space usage.

# Code Design

## Algorithm Choice:

The code uses the os.walk() function to traverse directories. This function is well-suited for this purpose because it generates the file names in a directory tree, walking either top-down or bottom-up. This allows the function to handle any depth of subdirectories, making it a robust choice for this problem.

## Data Structures:

A list is used to collect the paths of files that match the given suffix. This is a straightforward and efficient way to store the results. The use of os.path.join() ensures that the file paths are correctly constructed regardless of the operating system.
