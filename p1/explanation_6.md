Explanation:

Union Function:

- Use a set to collect all unique elements from both linked lists.
- Iterate through each linked list and add each element to the set.
- Create a new linked list and append all elements from the set.

Intersection Function:

- Use a set to collect elements from the first linked list.
- Use another set to collect common elements that are present in both linked lists.
- Iterate through the first linked list and add each element to the set.
- Iterate through the second linked list and check if each element is present in the first set.
- If an element is present in both sets, add it to the intersection set.
- Create a new linked list and append all elements from the intersection set.
