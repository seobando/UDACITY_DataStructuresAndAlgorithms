# Efficiency

## Time Complexity

1. Frequency Calculation: The frequency of each character is calculated using Counter(data), which takes 𝑂(𝑛) time, where 𝑛 is the length of the input data.
2. Heap Initialization: Creating the initial heap with heapq.heapify(heap) has a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑘 log 𝑘), where 𝑘 is the number of unique characters in the data.
3. Huffman Tree Construction: The while loop that merges nodes runs 𝑘 −1 times (since each iteration reduces the number of nodes by 1). Each heappop and heappush operation takes O(logk), making the total complexity for this part O(klogk).
4. Code Generation: Generating the Huffman codes involves a depth-first traversal of the tree, which takes O(k) time.
5. Encoding Data: Encoding the data involves replacing each character with its corresponding Huffman code, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
The overall time complexity for the huffman_encoding function is O(n+klogk).

For huffman_decoding:

Decoding Data: The decoding process involves traversing the tree for each bit in the encoded data, resulting in O(m⋅d), where 𝑚 is the length of the encoded data and 𝑑 is the maximum depth of the tree. In the worst case, 𝑑 can be O(logk).

Therefore, the overall time complexity for the huffman_decoding function is 𝑂 O(m⋅logk).

## Space Complexity

1. Frequency Calculation: The Counter object requires  O(k) space.
2. Heap: The heap used for constructing the Huffman tree also requires O(k) space.
3. Huffman Tree: The Huffman tree itself requires O(k) space, as each node corresponds to a unique character or an internal node.
4. Codes Dictionary: The dictionary holding the Huffman codes requires O(k) space.
5. Encoded Data: The encoded data requires O(m) space, where 𝑚 is the length of the encoded string.

Overall, the space complexity for huffman_encoding is O(n+k+m).

For huffman_decoding, the space complexity is dominated by the storage of the tree and the decoded data, resulting in O(m+k).

# Code Design

Algorithm Choice: 

The code uses Huffman encoding, a classic and efficient algorithm for data compression that creates variable-length codes based on character frequencies.

Data Structures:

- Counter from the collections module is used to efficiently calculate character frequencies.
- A min-heap (heapq) is used to construct the Huffman tree, ensuring efficient extraction of the minimum frequency nodes.
- A custom Node class (subclass of namedtuple) is used to represent tree nodes, providing clarity and immutability.
- The use of recursion in generate_codes provides a clean and straightforward method for traversing the tree to generate codes.
